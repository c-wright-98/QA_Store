# QA_Store

This is the documentation for the QA Store project, I have decided to design a store front webpage based on the requirements laid out in the project brief description, creating a shop that sells plants letting users navigate the website pages, view products, add them to cart and checkout

## Identifying Epics and tasks

Using the brief I was able to identify three main users of the site the store admin, customers and visitors. All three have various user stories for the requirements of the website. I broke down the requirements of the site into epics to categories the user stories to be able to create tasks for my KanBan board.
